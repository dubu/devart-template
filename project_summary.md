## Description

Rush hour. Dense metro.
Doors are open. Comes in people pushed.
Metro is within a narrow densely populated shortly.

Sur others they have to have light.
Now people are burnt red, then green people who are next to yellow.

The face glows people together
All the light and how beautiful they are.

Shed light on the dark world, let's make the light
